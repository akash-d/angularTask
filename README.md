# Angular Task 1

## Our goal

We want to see how you handle complex situations in angular. Use angular js 1.6.5 for development.

## Your task

The challenge before you is to create a apartment structure, where a user can enter apartment name and can create blocks and sub apartments.

There should be a copy option for sub apartment and delete option as well. 

On click of save apartment, an output object containing the entire apartment structure can be viewed.

## Stretch goals

Feel free to use something simple like `localStorage` to store apartment details each time the value is changed.

* Create a simple front end structure using bootstrap.

* Dont worry much about css, angular logic is what matters.
